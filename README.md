# Weiss Schnee webpage 

I used some simple HTML and CSS to create a simple webpage about Wiess Schnee. An anime character 

Pictures belong to their original users 

This designed as a simple one page webpage. 

Techniques used: calling id's, classes, using css to alter the look of the page so information can be displayed the way I wanted it to.
