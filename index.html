                    The 17-year-old heiress to the Schnee Family, a powerful high-class family based in Atlas which whose Schnee Dust Company provides much of the Dust despite the family being targeted by the White Fang due to the immoral business ethnics of her father Jacques Schnee which included mistreatment of Faunus laborers.Vol. 1, Ch. 15 While inheriting her family's white hair and blue eyes, Weiss gained a noticeable scar over her left eye as a result of fighting an Arma Gigas Grimm.White Trailer Weiss uses a Dust revolver/rapier named Myrtenaster. The sheath can create more than one change of elemental Dust, using a dial like silver encasement just above the bottom of her sword. The Dust crystals encrusted in the encasement allow Weiss to change the power of her sword in battle. Her Semblance is unique in the way that it is a hereditary trait in her family, consisting of "Glyphs" that have a variety of push and pull effects and later mastering the ability to summon previously defeated foes with the Arma Gigas as her primary summon.Vol. 3, Ch. 4 & Vol. 4, Ch. 9 <br>
                </p>

                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the fall of Beacon in the Volume 3 finale, Weiss is taken back to Atlas by Jacques Schnee.Vol. 3, Ch. 12 In Volume 4, her relationship with her father is still strained as she eventually got disinherited and confined in her room within the Schnee Estate as the result of losing her temper during a cocktail party.Vol. 4, Ch. 6–7 But once she masters summoning, Weiss escapes from her confinement with Klein's help and stowing away in an airship to find Winter in Mistral.Vol. 4, Ch. 11–12 In Volume 5, Weiss is captured by Raven Branwen after the cargo ship crash lands in the outskirts of Anima.Vol. 5, Ch. 2 However, she breaks free from her confinement and reunites with Yang.Vol. 5, Ch. 4 Eventually, the two of them make their way to Mistral and reunite with Ruby.Vol. 5, Ch. 6 During the Battle of Haven, Weiss is easily overpowered by Vernal and is fatally impaled by Cinder.

                   Weiss alludes to Snow White,[13] as her name is German for "White Snow".[13][not in citation given] Character designer Ein Lee said that Weiss was her favorite character among the four main girls to draw: "She's so delicate, and I love princess types."[2] </p>

           <p>
             Monty Oum had said that everything has been decided for Weiss in her life, and because of it, she is a bit of a rebel. This manifests itself in her physical appearance as she wears her ponytail to the side of her head, disrupting the symmetry of the rest of her outfit. When Professor Port states that Weiss has received everything she wanted in life, she responds that it is not entirely true, thinking of her father's attitude. She takes pride in her name and the company, though, as seen when she first meets Blake Belladonna, when she discusses it with her team in Mountain Glenn and when she confronts her father over it. <br>
            </p>
               <aside class = "side">

            <p>
             Considering the lyrics of her leitmotif "Mirror Mirror", it is very likely that Weiss has felt lonely throughout her life, which translated into a cold nature. Constant attacks by the White Fang added heavy strain to her life, explaining her often difficult personality. After warming up to people, she places a great deal of trust in her friends and confides in them when she feels the need without abandoning her usual strict attitude.
            <br>
            </p>
            <p>
             According to her voice actress, Kara Eberle, Weiss is "nice but can also be a little bit bitchy." She is irritable and confident in her abilities, though also acknowledges her deficiencies and the need to hone her skills further. Her confidence in her skills and intellect often comes off as arrogance to others. This is also mentioned by Kara, who called her the "know-it-all" type of person who also can become best friends with her acquaintances.
            <br>
            </p>
            <p>
             Weiss takes her time at Beacon more seriously than her teammates, taking notes even when the topic is not related to the knowledge she seeks. She equates such dedication in the classroom with dedication in the field. Thus, she is annoyed at those who do not take things seriously, especially when it comes to becoming protectors against the Grimm. Weiss remains calm and tactical during encounters and mentally coaches herself. She is thoughtful and fights with precision and coordination.
            <br>
            </p>
            <p>
             After speaking with Professor Port, Weiss' attitude appears to change, as she takes his suggestion to "be the best person [she] can be" to heart. She opens up to Ruby, though she does not halt future criticisms. Weiss' development carries into her whimsical and humorous side as she joins her team in a food fight against Team JNPR and a board game. In "Painting the Town...", Weiss attempts to joke but is met with negative criticism from Yang and Blake. Weiss also enjoys planning and participating in certain events, such as the Beacon Dance.
            <br>
            </p>
            <p>
             Weiss vows that as a Huntress, she will elevate the Schnee name from her father's dishonor to it and put her desires behind others' necessities. This solidifies in "Lessons Learned" when Weiss heeds her sister's advice and removes her bindings from the SDC to discover more about herself.
            <br>
            </p>
            <p>
             After being retrieved from Beacon and flown home, Weiss is truly affected by the loss that happened during the Fall of Beacon. She becomes increasingly intolerant of the Atlesian lifestyle she grew up in, seeing it as superficial and ignorant. Her change of perspective is demonstrated by her hostility toward Henry Marigold's insensitive and ignorant attitude about the charity event and her public outburst when a couple talks condescendingly about the destruction of Vale.
            <br>
            </p>
            <p>
             Weiss also becomes intimidated when anyone raises their voice in anger. This trait is first shown in "Taking Control" when she overhears an argument between her father and General Ironwood. It's also shown in "Known by its Song" when Yang snaps at her mother, Raven Branwen, for mocking Qrow Branwen and Taiyang Xiao Long, other members of her family. The latter incident shows Weiss remaining on edge around Yang even after her anger subsides.
            <br>
            </p>
            <p>
             Views on the White Fang and Faunus due to the ongoing violence between the SDC and the White Fang terrorist group, Weiss despises the White Fang and shows a noticeable distrust of the Faunus at first. The White Fang's activities seem to have contributed to a difficult childhood for Weiss, for she had close ties with numerous people who were either killed by or disappeared because of the White Fang. This led to her father frequently coming home angry, and this further colored Weiss' views on the White Fang and Faunus.
            <br>
            </p>
            <p>
            When Blake defends Sun Wukong's criminal acts, Weiss makes many derogatory comments about him and suggests he would likely join with the White Fang. However, shortly after the fight with Roman Torchwick, Weiss no longer cares about her argument with Blake, stating they are teammates and it changes nothing. Regardless, she says she remains unsure of how she feels about Sun, but they grow to be on friendlier terms. Weiss and the rest of her team keep Blake's status as a Faunus a secret.
            <br>
            </p>
            <p>
             Weiss' hostility toward the Faunus downgrades considerably through her time at Beacon, as seen when she shows concern for Velvet Scarlatina and the rest of Team CFVY. She is even friendlier and empathetic toward Blake, having placed trust in her as well after fighting alongside Blake against the White Fang several times.
        </p>
        <h3 class='sec'  id= "fighting_style"> Fighting Style</h3>
            <p>
           As the heiress of the Schnee Dust Company, Weiss was raised from youth to strive to be the best in all she did, and combat was no exception. As a testament to her skills, Weiss was on the top ranking of the sparring class during the events of the Vytal Festival. Weiss can move quickly and is creative on the battlefield, particularly with Ice Dust.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            Like many Huntsmen and Huntresses before her, Weiss has had her Aura unlocked, coating her body with a shield powered by her soul. As long as that shield remains, she cannot be wounded, although she can still feel pain when struck.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            Weiss' combat style relies heavily on ricocheting off either surrounding surfaces or her glyphs, allowing her to take control of the fight by rapidly attacking from multiple angles to keep the enemy off balance. She has been seen utilizing this tactic with her Arma Gigas Summon, rapidly transporting it between glyphs to confuse and ambush the enemy in mid-strike.<br>
            </p>
            <span class = "sec1">Weapon</span><br>
            <p>
            Weiss prepares to fight the Giant Armor
            Weiss' weapon of choice is Myrtenaster, a Multi-Action Dust Rapier. The rapier has a revolving chamber inside the guard, which has six slots in total, each of which contains a vial of powdered Dust. The revolving chamber is constantly stocked with red, cyan, purple, white, yellow, and blue Dust.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            Weiss utilizes the Dust in combat, either in raw form or in conjunction with her Semblance to create various effects that suit the situation. When not using Myrtenaster as a Dust supplier, Weiss utilizes her speed to dodge attacks and her sword to deliver damage through quick thrusts that leave little room for counters.<br>
            </p>
            <span class ="sec1">Semblance</span><br>

            <aside class = "side">

            </aside>
            <p>
            One of Weiss' most notable abilities is her Semblance, which allows her to create glyphs that can be used in a variety of ways: create a slippery platform to skate on at high speed, generate midair platforms to manipulate her trajectory in the air and perform limited Time Dilation that can speed up actions[4], to name a few.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            With mastery, a Schnee also has the ability to summon avatars of the foes that they have defeated. In "Lessons Learned", Winter Schnee specifies that the summoned foe had to have caused the Schnee to push past who they were and become who they are now. In that same episode, Weiss only manages to summon a tiny version of the sword wielded by the Arma Gigas she defeated in the "White" Trailer. Later, in the episode "Heroes and Monsters", Weiss unintentionally summons the arm of said Arma Gigas to protect Velvet Scarlatina. Nevertheless, she struggles to demonstrate this ability at first, and she tells her sister that "it's the only thing [she's] been having trouble with".<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            She can also summon the Boarbatusk that she defeated in Peter Port's classroom, as demonstrated when she involuntarily summons it to attack a party guest who offended her in "Tipping Point". After being grounded following the incident, Weiss devotes her time to mastering the ability, eventually learning to fully Summon the Arma Gigas in "Two Steps Forward, Two Steps Back". She can also cause her summons to teleport and use her glyphs as surfaces to jump off, as demonstrated in "Dread in the Air". In that same episode, she defeats a Queen Lancer and gains it as a summon.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            In the series, Weiss' glyphs have appeared in a variety of colors for unknown reasons. Blue and white normal glyphs have been shown with the base ability to push whatever is within their influence. Black glyphs have the ability to pull whatever is within their influence, and they appear to involve the use of Gravity Dust, evidenced by Myrtenaster's Dust chamber revolving when Weiss makes the first black glyph in the "Volume 5 Weiss Character Short".[5] The Time Dilation glyph has a gold-colored clock design and involves the use of Lightning Dust.[6] Summon glyphs are white and have their own unique designs. In Volume 5, using fire Dust with her glyphs make them become a red-orange color.<br>
            </p>
            <sapn class = "sec1">Dust</sapn><br>
            <p>
            Using a glyph to make an ice dome.
            Weiss frequently utilizes Dust and occasionally uses her Semblance to direct the movement and manifestation of it, such as in "Players and Pieces", where she does this to create a curved wall of ice between Ruby and the Death Stalker's stinger.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            Weiss has shown a preference for Ice Dust, only switching types if it provides her with an advantage, such as using Wind Dust against sonic based attacks, or to create certain types of glyphs such as black or Time Dilation glyphs. She has used Ice Dust to trap enemies, create a trail to push enemies from a height, create a slippery sheet of ice and form pointed ice chunks to use as projectiles.<br>
            </p>
            <span class = "sec1">Weakness </span><br>
            <p>
            Weiss seems to have limited endurance and stamina, as seen in "The Emerald Forest" after Ruby and Weiss are forced to retreat from a pack of Beowolves after a forest fire; Weiss is shown to be panting in exhaustion while Ruby is still fully energized.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            The biggest sign of her lack of endurance, however, is her inability to take heavy hits. Out of everyone on her team, she has been knocked out the most, such as by Nora Valkyrie with her watermelon hammer during the food fight, and the White Fang Lieutenant smashing her head into the ground.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            Despite her glyphs' durability, they have been demonstrated to be breakable, such as when she summons three black glyphs in an attempt to stop the cargo ship's crash. The ship falls far too fast or is too heavy for her, causing it to rip the glyphs apart as it falls through them. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
            While Weiss may be becoming more familiar with her Semblance's Summoning ability, larger summons like her Arma Gigas apparently take greater time and effort to manifest, as shown in her duel with Vernal, who kept interrupting Weiss' attempts to bring forth the sword-wielding warrior. This weakness was heavily exploited by Vernal.
